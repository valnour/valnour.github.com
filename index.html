      <h1>My Projects</h1>
      <ul>
	<li><a href="http://github.com/valnour/euler-perl/">euler-perl</a> - I
	decided to try out Project Euler in Perl, but there is not much
	progress. I just don't really have time to invest in this project, so
	it's gonna go really slow.
	<li><a href="http://github.com/valnour/euler-elisp/">euler-elisp</a> - 
	This was my first shot at Project Euler. The idea is that all problems
	will be solved in Emacs Lisp. This project is young, and is worked on
	as a last resort. Don't expect much progress anytime soon.</li>
