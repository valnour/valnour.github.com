      <h1>My computing environment</h1>
      <p>To most users, a computer's user interface is the most important part
      of a computer. For instance, the next time you read a review of a
      GNU/Linux distribution, notice how many screenshots there are. Why are
      there so many? Does the distribution package KDE? GNOME? XFCE? If so, than
      links should be placed to those desktop environments' websites, unless the
      distribution makes a major change only availble to it's users (probably
      should be done upstream though). But still, review after review, we see
      screenshots after screenshots. The point I always read about Windows 7, is
      that it looks so much like KDE. What I'm trying to say is that everyone is
      caught up in appearance, but not functionality.</p>
      <p>I am very interested in the way that people interact with computers. It
      is very fascinating to me. So after weeks and months and years spent
      trying to find the perfect desktop enviroment or window manager for my
      visual taste, I finally realized that that is not the most important
      part. It's the way your DE/WM interacts with your software that is
      important. The way that it stays out of your way. The way it extends and
      collapses to fit your needs, not your hardware's capabilities.</p>

      <h1>Emacs</h1>
      <p>The first part of the user interface puzzle is Emacs. Plenty of you
      will not agree with this, and that is ok. But for me, most of my time is
      spent in Emacs, so naturally, it should be the program most worried
      about. It should be the program that my entire computing environment wraps
      itself around. So when deciding on what else I needed to complete my
      environment, first I need to decide what I need that Emacs can give
      me.</p>
      <ul>
	<li>erc: an IRC client</li>
	<li>ansi-term, eshell: terminal emulators</li>
	<li>dired: file manager</li>
	<li>org-mode: organizational tool, todo list, notes system, etc.</li>
	<li>mingus: mpd client</li>
	<li>and of course, a very good text editor</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There is very little else that I do with a computer that can't be done
      with those few tools, all operating inside of Emacs. The next step is to
      determine what I need from my computer that Emacs can't fulfill, or at
      least, can't fulfill in the way that I need.</p>
      <ul>
	<li>web browser (w3 is good, but not for everything)</li>
	<li>image editor (emacs can already view images)</li>
	<li>the occasional pdf</li>
	<li>music server</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are a few more edge cases, like a pdf viewer, or rarely an IM
      client, but those aren't used enough to make or break my case. Regardless,
      Emacs' assortment of software is pretty good. So now we just need a few
      more pieces to complete our interface puzzle.</p>

      <h1>What's missing</h1>
      <p>Emacs does not give me a good enough (for me) web browser, so instead,
      I have turend to Conkeror. Conkeror provides emacs keybindings, and other
      emacs-isms, with a very modern web browser. Conkeror is customizable, with
      javascript, and you can even write your own functions in javascript.</p>
      <p>Gimp provides a good enough image editor, and easily drops into most
      WMs. The only issue with using Gimp as an image editor is it's need to
      display across at least three windows. This throws a monkey wrench at any
      tiling window managers right off the bat, but nothing we can't solve.</p>
      <p>I have yet to find a really suitable PDF viewer, as I don't read too
      many PDFs, but I read enough that I feel it is import to mention. The one
      that I do use is XPDF. XPDF is probably not everyone's first choice for a
      PDF viewer, but it get's the job done, and doesn't have much overhead, so
      it's what I've got.</p>
      <p>Even though I have mingus listed as one of the things Emacs provides,
      Emacs doesn't provide the actual music server. For me, there is only one
      choice, MPD. It can easily be installed, configured, and forgotten.</p>

      <h1>Tying it all together</h1>
      <p>Since the center of my environment is Emacs, and is complimented with
      Conkeror's emacs-isms, an Emacs-ish window manager would be
      preferable. The choice I made in window manager really needs to
      incorporate these same principals. Stumpwm was my natural choice for the
      window manager of my environment because it provides the following
      features.</p>
      <ul>
	<li>Written in Common Lisp and provides a REPL</li>
	<li>uses Emacs-like frames</li>
	<li>Windows are independent of frames (like buffers)</li>
	<li>uses Emacs-like keybindings</li>
	<li>.stumpwmrc, the configuration file, is written in Common Lisp,
	allowing you to write your own commands.</li>
	<li>using stumpish, an external tool, you can send commands to
	Stumpwm</li>
	<li>stumpwm-mode (for emacs) provides a Slime-like interface for
	Stumpwm</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Screenshots</h1>
      <p>Here is a screenshot of the writing of this file</p>

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>I feel that with this environment, the need for a traditional Desktop
      Environment is almost completely
      eliminated. <a href="http://github.com/dto/xiomacs/tree/master">Xiomacs</a>
      appears to be a project to add some more desktop environment features to
      Stumpwm, however, I'm much too lazy to get it working as it is in
      pre-alpha stage, but the screenshots look fancy.</p>
